## Build A LibNet Broker

The application (TinyLib) can manage a tiny library with core functions.
At some moment you want to add a method to let your library order a book by ISBN.
Given your library has yet a limited collection,  
but there is a library network (LibNet), 
and LibNet has a publically available API that provides partner libraries with books, 
how would you extend your TinyLib to communicate with LibNet and order books there, if TinyLib doesn't have it?
